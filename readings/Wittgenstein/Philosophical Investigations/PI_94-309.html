<TR><TD ALIGN=RIGHT VALIGN=TOP><FONT FACE="Geneva, Arial" SIZE=3>94.</FONT></TD><TD ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Geneva, Arial">'A proposition is a queer thing!' Here we have in germ the subliming of our whole account of logic. The tendency to assume a pure intermediary between the propositional <I>signs</I> and the facts. Or even to try to purify, to sublime, the signs themselves. -- For our forms of expression prevent us in all sorts of ways from seeing that nothing out of the ordinary is involved, by sending us in pursuit of chimeras.</FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD ALIGN=RIGHT VALIGN=TOP><FONT FACE="Geneva, Arial" SIZE=3>95.</FONT></TD><TD ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Geneva, Arial">"Thought must be something unique." When we say, and mean, that such-and-such is the case, we -- and our meaning -- do not stop anywhere short of the fact; but we mean: <I>this -- is -- so.</I> But this paradox (which has the form of a truism) can also be expressed in this way: <I>Thought</I> can be of what is <I>not</I> the case.</FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD ALIGN=RIGHT VALIGN=TOP><FONT FACE="Geneva, Arial" SIZE=3>96.</FONT></TD><TD ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Geneva, Arial">Other illusions come from various quarters to attach themselves to the special one spoken of here. Thought, language, now appear to us as the unique correlate, picture, of the world. These concepts: proposition, language, thought, world, stand in line one behind the other, each equivalent to each. (But what are these words to be used for now? The language-game in which they are to be applied is missing.)</FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD ALIGN=RIGHT VALIGN=TOP><FONT FACE="Geneva, Arial" SIZE=3>97.</FONT></TD><TD ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Geneva, Arial">Thought is surrounded by a halo. -- Its essence, logic, presents an order, in fact the a priori order of the world: that is, the order of possibilities, which must be common to both world and thought. But this order, it seems, must be utterly <I>simple.</I> It is <I>prior</I> to all experience, must run through all experience; no empirical cloudiness or uncertainty can be allowed to affect it. -- It must rather be of the purest crystal. But this crystal does not appear as an abstraction; but as something concrete, indeed, as the most concrete -- as it were the <I>hardest</I> thing there is (<I>Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</I> No. 5.5563).
<P>
We are under the illusion that what is peculiar, profound, essential, in our investigation, resides in its trying to grasp the incomparable essence of language. That is, the order existing between the concepts of proposition, word, proof, truth, experience, and so on. This order is a <I>super</I> -- order between -- so to speak -- <I>super</I> -- concepts. Whereas, of course, if the words "language", "experience", "world", have a use, it must be as humble a one as that of the words "table", "lamp", "door".</FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD ALIGN=RIGHT VALIGN=TOP><FONT FACE="Geneva, Arial" SIZE=3>98.</FONT></TD><TD ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Geneva, Arial">On the one hand it is clear that ever sentence in our language is in order as it is. That is to say, we are not <I>striving after</I> an ideal, as if our ordinary vague sentences had not yet got a quite unexceptionable sense, and a perfect language awaited construction by us. -- On the other hand it seems clear that where there is sense there must be perfect order. So there must be perfect order even in the vaguest sentence.</FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD ALIGN=RIGHT VALIGN=TOP><FONT FACE="Geneva, Arial" SIZE=3>99.</FONT></TD><TD ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Geneva, Arial">The sense of a sentence -- one would like to say -- may, of course, leave this or that open, but the sentence must nevertheless have a definite sense. An indefinite sense -- that would really not be a sense at all. -- This is like: An indefinite boundary is not really a boundary at all. Here one thinks perhaps: if I say "I have locked the man up fast in the room -- there is only one door left open" -- then I simply haven't locked him in at all; his being locked in is a sham. One would be inclined to say here: "You haven't done anything at all". An enclosure with a hole in it is as good as <I>none.</I> -- But is that true?</FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD ALIGN=RIGHT VALIGN=TOP><FONT FACE="Geneva, Arial" SIZE=3>100.</FONT></TD><TD ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Geneva, Arial">"But still, it isn't a game, if there is some vagueness <I>in the rules."</I> -- But does this prevent its being a game? -- "Perhaps you'll call it a game, but at any rate it certainly isn't a perfect game." This means it has impurities, and what I am interested in at present is the pure article. -- But I want to say: we misunderstand the role of the ideal in our language. That is to say: we too should call it a game, only we are dazzled by the ideal and therefore fail to see clearly the actual use of the word game.</FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD ALIGN=RIGHT VALIGN=TOP><FONT FACE="Geneva, Arial" SIZE=3>101.</FONT></TD><TD ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Geneva, Arial">We want to say that there can't be any vagueness in logic. The idea now absorbs us, that the ideal <I>'must'</I> be found in reality. Mean while we do not as yet see how it occurs there, nor do we understand the nature of this "must". We think it must be in reality: for we think we already see it there.</FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD ALIGN=RIGHT VALIGN=TOP><FONT FACE="Geneva, Arial" SIZE=3>102.</FONT></TD><TD ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Geneva, Arial">The strict and clear rules of the logical structure of propositions appear to us as something in the background -- hidden in the medium of the understanding. I already see them (even though through a medium): for I understand the propositional sign, I use it to say something.</FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD ALIGN=RIGHT VALIGN=TOP><FONT FACE="Geneva, Arial" SIZE=3>103.</FONT></TD><TD ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Geneva, Arial">The ideal, as we think of it, is unshakable. You can never get outside it; you must always turn back. There is no outside; outside you cannot breathe. -- Where does this idea come from? It is like a pair of glasses on our nose through which we see whatever we look at. It never occurs to us to take them off.</FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD ALIGN=RIGHT VALIGN=TOP><FONT FACE="Geneva, Arial" SIZE=3>106.</FONT></TD><TD ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Geneva, Arial">Here it is difficult as it were to keep our heads up, -- to see that we must stick to the subjects of our everyday thinking, and not
go astray and imagine that we have to describe extreme subtleties, which in turn we are after all quite unable to describe with the means at our disposal. We feel as if we had to repair a torn spider's web with our fingers.</FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD ALIGN=RIGHT VALIGN=TOP><FONT FACE="Geneva, Arial" SIZE=3>107.</FONT></TD><TD ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Geneva, Arial">The more narrowly we examine actual language, the sharper becomes the conflict between it and our requirement. (For the crystalline purity of logic was, of course, not a <I>result of investigation</I>: it was a requirement.) The conflict becomes intolerable; the requirement is now in danger of becoming empty. -- We have got on to slippery ice where there is no friction and so in a certain sense the conditions are ideal, but also, just because of that, we are unable to walk. We want to walk: so we need <I>friction.</I> Back to the rough ground!</FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD ALIGN=RIGHT VALIGN=TOP><FONT FACE="Geneva, Arial" SIZE=3>108.</FONT></TD><TD ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Geneva, Arial">We see that what we call "sentence" and "language" has not the formal unity that I imagined, but is the family of structures more or less related to one another. -- But what becomes of logic now? Its rigor seems to be giving way here. -- But in that case doesn't logic altogether disappear? -- For how can it lose its rigor? Of course not by our bargaining any of its rigor out of it. -- The <I>preconceired</I> idea of crystalline purity can only be removed by turning our whole examination around. (One might say: the axis of reference of our examination must be rotated, but about the fixed point of our real need.)
<P>
The philosophy of logic speaks of sentences and words in exactly the sense in which we speak of them in ordinary life when we say e.g.
"Here is a Chinese sentence", or "No, that only looks like writing; it is actually just an ornament" and so on.
<P>
We are talking about the spatial and temporal phenomenon of language, not about some non -- spatial, non -- temporal phantasm. [Note in margin: Only it is possible to be interested in a phenomenon in a variety of ways]. But we talk about it as we do about the pieces in chess when we are stating the rules of the game, not describing their physical properties.
<P>
The question "What is a word really?" is analogous to "What is a piece in chess?"</FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD ALIGN=RIGHT VALIGN=TOP><FONT FACE="Geneva, Arial" SIZE=3>109.</FONT></TD><TD ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Geneva, Arial">It was true to say that our considerations could not be scientific ones. It was not of any possible interest to us to find out empirically that, contrary to our preconceived ideas, it is possible to think such-and-such -- whatever that may mean. (The conception of thought as a gaseous medium.) And we may not advance any kind of theory. There must not be anything hypothetical in our considerations. We must do away with all explanation, and description alone must take its place. And this description gets its light, that is to say its purpose, from the philosophical problems. These are, of course, not empirical problems, they are solved, rather, by looking into the workings of our language, and that in such a way as to make us recognize those workings: in despite of an urge to misunderstand them. The problems are solved, not by giving new information, but by arranging what we have always known. Philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language.</FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD ALIGN=RIGHT VALIGN=TOP><FONT FACE="Geneva, Arial" SIZE=3>110.</FONT></TD><TD ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Geneva, Arial">Language (or thought?) is something unique" -- this proves to be a superstition (not a mistake!), itself produced by grammatical illusions.
<P>
And now the impressiveness retreats to these illusions, to the problems.</FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD ALIGN=RIGHT VALIGN=TOP><FONT FACE="Geneva, Arial" SIZE=3>111.</FONT></TD><TD ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Geneva, Arial">The problems arising through a misinterpretation of our forms of language have the character of <I>depth.</I> They are deep disquietudes; their roots are as deep in us as the forms of our language and their significance is as great as the importance of our language. Let us ask ourselves: why do we feel a grammatical joke to be <I>deep</I>? (And that is what the depth of philosophy is.)</FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD ALIGN=RIGHT VALIGN=TOP><FONT FACE="Geneva, Arial" SIZE=3>112.</FONT></TD><TD ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Geneva, Arial">A simile that has been absorbed into the forms of our language produces a false appearance, and this disquiets us. "But this isn't how it is!" -- we say. "Yet <I>this</I> is how it has to <I>be!</I>"</FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD ALIGN=RIGHT VALIGN=TOP><FONT FACE="Geneva, Arial" SIZE=3>113.</FONT></TD><TD ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Geneva, Arial">"But <I>this</I> is how it is --" I say to myself over and over again.

<TR><TD ALIGN=RIGHT VALIGN=TOP><FONT FACE="Geneva, Arial" SIZE=3>114.</FONT></TD><TD ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Geneva, Arial">(<I>Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus,</I> 4.5): "The general form of propositions is: This is how things are." That is the kind of proposition that one repeats to oneself countless times. One thinks that one is tracing the outline of the thing's nature over and over again, and one is merely tracing round the frame through which we look at it.</FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD ALIGN=RIGHT VALIGN=TOP><FONT FACE="Geneva, Arial" SIZE=3>116.</FONT></TD><TD ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Geneva, Arial">When philosophers use a word -- "knowledge", "being", "object", "I", "proposition", "name" -- and try to grasp the essence of the thing, one must always ask oneself: is the word ever actually used in this way in the language which is its original home? -- 
<P>
What <I>we</I> do is to bring words back from their metaphysical to their everyday use.</FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD ALIGN=RIGHT VALIGN=TOP><FONT FACE="Geneva, Arial" SIZE=3>117.</FONT></TD><TD ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Geneva, Arial">You say to me: "You understand this expression, don't you? Well then -- I am using it in the sense you are familiar with." -- As if the sense were an atmosphere accompanying the word, which it carried with it into every kind of application.
<P>
If, for example, someone says that the sentence "This is here" (saying which he points to an object in front of him) makes sense to him then he should ask himself in what special circumstances this sentence is actually used. There it does make sense.</FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD ALIGN=RIGHT VALIGN=TOP><FONT FACE="Geneva, Arial" SIZE=3>118.</FONT></TD><TD ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Geneva, Arial">Where does our investigation get its importance from, since it seems only to destroy everything interesting, that is, all that is great and important?

<TR><TD ALIGN=RIGHT VALIGN=TOP><FONT FACE="Geneva, Arial" SIZE=3>119.</FONT></TD><TD ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Geneva, Arial">The results of philosophy are the uncovering of one or another piece of plain nonsense and of bumps that the understanding has got by running its head up against the limits of language.

Is this language somehow too coarse and material for what we want to say? <I>Then how is another one to be constructed?</I> -- And how strange that we should be able to do anything at all with the one we travel
<P>
In giving explanations I already have to use language full -- blown (not some sort of preparatory, provisional one); this by itself shows that I can adduce only exterior facts about language.
<P>
Yes, but then how can these explanations satisfy us? -- Well, your very questions were framed in this language; they had to be expressed in this language, if there was anything to ask!
<P>
And your scruples are misunderstandings.
<P>
Your questions refer to words; so I have to talk about words.
<P>
You say: the point isn't the word, but its meaning, and you think of the meaning as a thing of the same kind as the word, though also different from the word. Here the word, there the meaning. The money, and the cow that you can buy with it. (But contrast: money, and its use.)</FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD ALIGN=RIGHT VALIGN=TOP><FONT FACE="Geneva, Arial" SIZE=3>121.</FONT></TD><TD ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Geneva, Arial">One might think: if philosophy speaks of the use of the word "philosophy" there must be a second -- order philosophy.

<TR><TD ALIGN=RIGHT VALIGN=TOP><FONT FACE="Geneva, Arial" SIZE=3>122.</FONT></TD><TD ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Geneva, Arial">A main source of our failure to understand is that we do not <I>command a clear view</I> of the use of our words. -- Our grammar is lacking in just this sort of perspicuity. A perspicuous representation produces just that understanding which consists in 'seeing connections'. Hence the importance of finding and inventing <I>intermediate cases.</I> 
<P>
The concept of a perspicuous representation is of fundamental significance for us. It earmarks the form of account we give, the way we look at things. (Is this a 'Weltanschauung'?)</FONT></TD></TR>

For it cannot give it any foundation either.

It leaves everything as it is.

It also leaves mathematics as it is, and no mathematical discovery can advance it. A "leading problem of mathematical logic" is for us a problem of mathematics like any other.</FONT></TD></TR>

(And this does not mean that one is sidestepping a difficulty.)
<P>
The fundamental fact here is that we lay down rules, a technique, for a game, and that then when we follow the rules, things do not turn out as we had assumed. That we are therefore as it were entangled in our own rules.
<P>
This entanglement in our rules is what we want to understand (i.e. get a clear view of).
<P>
It throws light on our concept of <I>meaning</I> something. For in those cases things turn out otherwise than we had meant, foreseen. That is just what we say when, for example, a contradiction appears: "I didn't mean it like that."
<P>
The civil status of a contradiction, or its status in civil life: there is the philosophical problem.</FONT></TD></TR>

To this end we shall constantly be giving prominence to distinctions which our ordinary forms of language easily make us overlook. This may make it look as if we saw it as our task to reform language.
<P>
Such a reform for particular practical purposes, an improvement in our terminology designed to prevent misunderstandings in practice, is perfectly possible. But these are not the cases we have to do with. The confusions which occupy us arise when language is like an engine idling, not when it is doing work.</FONT></TD></TR>

For the clarity that we are aiming at is indeed <I>complete</I> clarity But this simply means that the philosophical problems should <I>completely</I> disappear.
<P>
The read discovery is the one that makes me capable of stopping doing philosophy when I want to. -- The one that gives philosophy peace, so that it is no longer tormented by questions which bring in question. -- Instead, we now demonstrate a method, by examples; and the series of examples can be broken off. -- Problems are solved (difficulties eliminated), not a <I>single</I> problem.
<P>
There is not a philosophical method, though there are indeed methods, like different therapies.</FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD ALIGN=RIGHT VALIGN=TOP><FONT FACE="Geneva, Arial" SIZE=3>134.</FONT></TD><TD ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Geneva, Arial">Let us examine the proposition: "This is how things are." -- How can I say that this is the general form of propositions? -- It is first and foremost <I>itself</I> a proposition, an English sentence, for it has a subject and a predicate. But how is this sentence applied -- that is, in our everyday language? For I got it from there and nowhere else.
<P>
We may say' e.g.: "He explained his position to me, said that this was how things were, and that therefore he needed an advance". So far, then, one can say that that sentence stands for any statement It is employed as a propositional <I>schema,</I> but on) because it has the construction of an English sentence. It would be possible to say instead "such and such is the case", "this is the situation", and so on. It would also be possible here simply to use a letter, a variable, as in symbolic logic. But no one is going to call the letter "p" the general form of propositions. To repeat: "This is how things are" had that position only because it is itself what one calls an English sentence. But though it is a proposition, still it gets employed as a propositional variable. To say that this proposition agrees (or does not agree) with reality would be obvious nonsense. Thus it illustrates the fact that <I>one</I> feature of our concept of a proposition is, sounding <I>like a proposition.</I></FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD ALIGN=RIGHT VALIGN=TOP><FONT FACE="Geneva, Arial" SIZE=3>135.</FONT></TD><TD ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Geneva, Arial">But haven't we got a concept of what a proposition is, of what we take "proposition" to mean? -- Yes; just as we also have a concept of what we mean by "game". Asked what a proposition is -- whether it is another person or ourselves that we have to answer -- we shall give examples and these will include what one may call inductively defined series of propositions. <I>This</I> is the kind of way in which we have such a concept as proposition'. (Compare the concept of a proposition with the concept of number.)</FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD ALIGN=RIGHT VALIGN=TOP><FONT FACE="Geneva, Arial" SIZE=3>136.</FONT></TD><TD ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Geneva, Arial">At bottom, giving "This is how things are" as the general form of propositions is the same as giving the definition: a proposition is whatever can be true or false. For instead of "This is how things are" I could have said "This is true". (Or again "This is false".) But we have
<P>
'p' is true = p<BR>
'p' is false = not-p.
<P>
And to say that a proposition is whatever can be true or false amounts to saying: we call something a proposition when <I>in our language</I> we apply the calculus of truth functions to it.
<P>
Now it looks as if the definition -- a proposition is whatever can be true or false -- determined what a proposition was, by saying: what fits the concept 'true', or what the concept 'true' fits, is a proposition. So it is as if we had a concept of true and false, which we could use to determine what is and what is not a proposition. What <I>engages</I> with the concept of truth (as with a cogwheel) is a proposition.
<P>
But this is a bad picture. It is as if one were to say "The king in chess is <I>the</I> piece that one can check." But this can mean no more than that in our game of chess we only check the king. Just as the proposition that only a <I>proposition</I> can be true or false can say no more than that we only predicate "true" and "false" of what we call a proposition. And what a proposition is is in one sense determined by the rules of sentence formation (in English for example), and in another sense by the use of the sign in the language-game. And the use of the words "true" and "false" may be among the constituent parts of this v game; and if so it <I>belongs</I> to our concept 'Proposition' but does not AS we might also say, check <I>belongs</I> to our concept of the king in chess (as so to speak a constituent part of it). To say that check did not it our concept of the pawns, would mean that a game in which pawns were checked, in which, say, the players who lost their pawns lost, would be uninteresting or stupid or too complicated or something of the kind.</FONT></TD></TR>

We find it out much as we find out which letter of the alphabet comes after 'K' by saying the alphabet up to 'K' to ourselves. Now in what sense does 'L' fit on to this series of letters? -- In <I>that</I> sense "true" and "false" could be said to fit propositions; and a child might be taught to distinguish between propositions and other expressions by being told "Ask yourself if you can say 'is true' after it. If these words fit it's a proposition." (And in the same way one might have said: Ask yourself if you can put the words <I>"This is</I> how things are:" in front of it.)</FONT></TD></TR>

<TR><TD ALIGN=RIGHT VALIGN=TOP><FONT FACE="Geneva, Arial" SIZE=3>138.</FONT></TD><TD ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Geneva, Arial">But can't the meaning of a word that I understand fit the sense of a sentence that I understand?

But we understand the meaning of a word when we hear or say it; we grasp it in a flash, and what we grasp in this way is surely something different from the use which is extended in time!</FONT></TD></TR>

If he now said, for example: "Oh, I know what 'pain' means; what I don't know is whether <I>this,</I> that I have now, is pain" -- we should merely shake our heads and be forced to regard his words as a queer reaction which we have no idea what to do with.

That expression of doubt has no place in the language-game; but if we cut out human behavior, which is the expression of sensation, it looks as if I might <I>legitimately</I> begin to doubt afresh.
